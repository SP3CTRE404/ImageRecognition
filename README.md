# CNN Data Flow Visualization

This repository contains a visualization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, illustrating the flow of data through its various layers.

## Description

The visualization depicts a typical CNN architecture used for image classification. It showcases the sequential processing of an input image through convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, max pooling, flattening, fully connected layers, and dropout, culminating in the output classification.

## Layers Visualized

The diagram includes the following layers:

* **Input Image (1 channel):** The initial input to the network.
* **Convolutional Layers (conv1, conv2, conv3, conv4):** These layers extract features from the input image.
* **Batch Normalization Layers (bn1, bn2, bn3, bn4, bn5):** These layers normalize the activations, improving training stability.
* **Max Pooling (MaxPool2d):** This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
* **Flatten:** This layer converts the multi-dimensional feature maps into a one-dimensional vector.
* **Fully Connected Layers (fc1, fc2):** These layers perform classification based on the extracted features.
* **Dropout:** This layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
* **Output (10 classes):** The final output of the network, representing the classification results.

## Visualization Method

The visualization was created using a diagramming tool (likely draw.io or a similar program) to provide precise control over the layout and appearance. This manual creation allows for a clear and concise representation of the CNN architecture's data flow.

## How to Recreate the Visualization

To recreate the visualization, follow these steps:

1.  **Use a Diagramming Tool:** Open draw.io (diagrams.net) or a similar diagramming tool.
2.  **Create Boxes:** Add rectangular boxes for each layer listed above.
3.  **Add Text:** Add the layer names inside each box.
4.  **Arrange Boxes:** Arrange the boxes to match the layout shown in the visualization.
5.  **Add Arrows:** Use arrows to connect the boxes, showing the flow of data.
6.  **Customize:** Adjust colors, fonts, and styles as desired.
7.  **Export:** Export the diagram as a PNG or SVG file.
